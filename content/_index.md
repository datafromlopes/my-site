## Hi there üëã

I am a **Senior Data Engineer** and MSc candidate in Computer Science at USP, specializing in Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a research focus on enhancing text-to-SQL capabilities for geospatial data. Over the past six years, I have designed and implemented scalable solutions for both batch and real-time data processing, with expertise spanning distributed systems, cloud platforms, and modern data architectures.

My background in data engineering directly complements my research in AI, enabling me to leverage advanced data processing, cleaning, and integration pipelines to build more reliable, efficient, and production-ready machine learning models. Passionate about bridging cutting-edge AI research with real-world applications, I focus on scalable, intelligent systems that deliver measurable impact.

#### Interests
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Relational Databases
- Neural Networks
- NoSQL Databases
- Computational Linguistics
